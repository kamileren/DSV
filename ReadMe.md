# Data Structures Overview

## Part 1 - Array-Based Structures
- **ArrayList**: A dynamic array that automatically resizes, allowing elements to be added or removed efficiently.
- **ArrayStack**: A stack data structure implemented using an array, enabling last-in-first-out (LIFO) operations.
- **ArrayDeque**: A circular buffer implemented with an array, facilitating operations at both ends of the queue.
- **DualArrayDeque**: A deque that uses two arrays to optimize operations, improving performance for various operations from either side as well as the center.

## Part 2 - Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List**: A series of elements where each element points to the next, allowing for efficient insertion and removal.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Similar to a singly linked list but with each element pointing to both the next and previous elements, offering more flexibility in element traversal.
